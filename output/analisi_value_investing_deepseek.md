### Calculations:

#### 1. **Debt-to-Equity Ratio**:
\[
\text{Debt-to-Equity Ratio} = \frac{\text{Total Debt}}{\text{Equity}} = \frac{707,461}{449,202} = 1.58
\]

#### 2. **Current Ratio**:
\[
\text{Current Ratio} = \frac{\text{Current Assets}}{\text{Current Liabilities}} = \frac{564,201}{174,920} = 3.23
\]

#### 3. **Net Profit Margin**:
\[
\text{Net Profit Margin} = \left(\frac{\text{Net Income}}{\text{Total Revenue}}\right) \times 100 = \left(\frac{66,077}{620,662}\right) \times 100 = 10.65\%
\]

#### 4. **ROE (Return on Equity)**:
\[
\text{ROE} = \left(\frac{\text{Net Income}}{\text{Equity}}\right) \times 100 = \left(\frac{66,077}{449,202}\right) \times 100 = 14.71\%
\]

#### 5. **Earnings Per Share (EPS)**:
\[
\text{EPS} = \frac{\text{Net Income}}{\text{Number of Shares}} = \frac{66,077}{68,000} = 0.97 \, \text{€ per share}
\]

#### 6. **Price-to-Earnings (P/E) Ratio**:
\[
\text{P/E Ratio} = \frac{\text{Share Price}}{\text{EPS}} = \frac{112.00}{0.97} = 115.46
\]
